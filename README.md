# HolocronDB

A simple key value store that I personally use for learning rust and getting
comfortable with its learning curve, including concurrency support, borrowing
and whatnot. Part of The Sprawl Project.


## Try it out!

1. Clone using SSH

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:the-sprawl-project/holocron-db.git
```

2. Build the project

```bash
$ cd holocron-db
$ make build
```

3. Run the server first

```bash
$ target/debug/holocrondb_server
```

4. Run the client

```bash
$ target/debug/holocrondb_client
```

5. Type `h` for help within the client.
